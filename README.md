Javascript Roguelike
====================

Back in 2005, I was heavily into Nethack and other roguelikes and wanted to
write my own. Now it's $YEAR and I still want to.

This code is embarrassing, but it may be a useful starting point for my
continuing quest to write my game. You might even find it useful, although it
seems unlikely.

I've tested in Chrome, and I'm pretty sure it used to work in Firefox 1.0 and
IE 6.
